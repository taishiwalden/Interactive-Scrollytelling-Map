### CENTERING PALESTINIAN HUMAN RIGHTS: RECOMMENDATIONS FOR A COALITION

I co-wrote a research analysis capstone providing a detailed blueprint for the creation of a coalition that will leverage international political influence to center Palestinian human rights within the conflict and empower the Palestinian voice in political discussion. I authored Chapter 3, which examines internal threats to Palestinian human rights.

I wanted to create a visual format highlighting the key arguments for this capstone, so a wider audience could engage with it. I used [Anjana Sofia Vakil's template for MapBox GL JS "scrollytelling solutions"](https://github.com/vakila/mapbox-concatenate-workshop/blob/master/scrollytelling/DOCUMENTATION.md) as a guide to help me.
